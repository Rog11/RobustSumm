          Character Swapping, Deletion and Insertion: The main motivation
          behind applying these perturbations is that they can be used to
          simulate common typo errors and input noise that can occur in
          real-world scenarios. We test the modelsâ€™ resilience by
          assessing its ability to correct or accommodate such variations in
          summarization.
